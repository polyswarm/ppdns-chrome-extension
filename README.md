# NectarNet Beta Chrome Extension

A browser extension intended to collect and send security relevant data to PolySwarm, in exchange for distributing rewards in the form of [NCT](https://polyswarm.io/aboutnct) tokens.

The first browser that we support is Chrome.
We are working on support for Safari, which should be available soon.

For any browser extension it takes time to submit and be accepted by the Chrome store and Apple store,
so for now, users have to work with the .tar.gz files we release here on GitHub.
